    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This policy was last updated on 4 January 2024</p>
    <p>Please read this privacy policy if you use the MUSTT mobile software application (the “App”), or the MUSTT website (together with the App, the “MUSTT Platform”) in any location other than the USA, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany or Australia, which require their own terms of use. As well as to users of the MUSTT Platform, this privacy policy also applies to any other individuals whose data we may process, except for our employees, candidates, event partners and/or artists. If you are under these data subjects’ categories, please check out the relevant privacy policy for you by reaching out to the MUSTT team at mustmarketplace@gmail.com. This privacy policy explains how Mustt Limited (“MUSTT”, “we” or “us”) uses your personal information to provide the MUSTT Platform. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, feel free to contact us musttmarketplace@gmail.com. Occasionally, we might need to update this policy, and will let you know of any updates. If we make any changes to the way we use your personal information, we will let you know by posting a notice on the MUSTT Platform or sending you an email at the email address provided at the time you registered.</p>
    
    <h3>1. ABOUT US</h3>
    <p>We are an event discovery platform that matches users with events and activities that match their vibe. The scope of our services may change from time to time. Where our services change, we will notify you and update this privacy policy.</p> 
    
    <h3>2. OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>2.1. For the purpose of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) (and any other applicable UK laws, such as the UK GDPR), MUSTT is the “Data Controller” where you are using the MUSTT Platform.</p>
    <p>2.2. This privacy policy explains how we use your personal information and other data we collect when you use the MUSTT Platform.</p>
      
    <h3>3. THE BASIS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA</h3>
    <p>3.1 MUSTT processes your data to allow you to use, and us to deliver our services to you on the MUSTT Platform.</p>
    <p>3.2. Some of your data will be processed based on MUSTT’s legitimate interests, including photographs, and audio and video recordings of events, to allow us to successfully provide the event experience set up for  you on the MUSTT Platform. Legitimate interest is also our lawful basis for processing in-app analytics data (except where your consent is required) so we can enhance and monitor app performance, account activity, or website logs etc, and prevent fraudulent or other malicious activities, and produce website visitor logs for cybersecurity and/or error tracking purposes. Legitimate interest is also our lawful basis for profiling. We also rely on our legitimate interest to collect your date of birth, so we can make sure you are allowed to purchase tickets, since some events will require you to be at least 18, and to share some aggregated information with Event Partners for their own internal statistical and sales control purposes. Legitimate interest is also our lawful basis for sending you any post-event reviews or surveys to complete after you have attended an event,  or after you have contacted our team, to help make MUSTT even better. Where we are processing any personal data based on legitimate interest, we have conducted an assessment to ensure that the individual’s interests do not override those legitimate interests.</p>
    <p>3.3. We will ask for your consent if we need to share your data with third parties for any reason not mentioned in this privacy policy which is not necessary for you to be able to use the MUSTT Platform. We will also ask for your consent in some other cases, for example in order to use your location to sync your music library or to send you notifications, as well as for market research, or any other survey which does not fall under post-event reviews, you will have a right to say no.    </p>
    <p>3.4. We may ask for your consent in other cases where we process your data. You can revoke your consent at any time by contacting us at mustmarketplace@gmail.com. Please note that the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before the withdrawal.    </p>
    <p>3.5 We will rely on your explicit consent for processing special categories of personal data that are considered sensitive.    </p>
    
    <h3>4. COLLECTED INFORMATION    </h3>
    <p>4.1. To help us manage your registration and ticket sales, we will process and store all personal information you give when you register on the MUSTT Platform, and any personal information which is generated when you navigate and use the MUSTT Platform. We also use this information to analyse trends in your behaviour as this helps us to determine your preferences, habits, tastes, geographic location and favourite events, which will maximise your use and enjoyment of the MUSTT Platform. We might also take some information from email communications between you and MUSTT and store this in separate documents. To find out more about how we use your personal information, see Clause 6 below.    </p>
    <p>4.2. The types of personal information we collect may include:    </p>

      <p>Your image or recordings – we might get photographs, audio or video recordings of events listed on the MUSTT Platform.

      <p>Your preferences – we may collect information about your purchase history, events you have viewed, attended or enquired about, any events you have favourited, shared or invited people to attend and any feedback you may give or reviews you may submit;    </p>

      <p>Your interactions with us – for example if you send us information via email, survey, social media, customer service communications or other methods, this may be stored on our systems; and    </p>
      <p>Technical information – when you use the MUSTT Platform, we automatically receive and record information in our logs from your browser or mobile platform, including the location, IP address, strictly necessary cookie information and details about the page you requested. We will also collect information regarding your use of the MUSTT Platform, mobile device information and browser information.    </p>
      <p>Feedback - when conducting a survey, we may collect your views, opinions and suggestions.    </p>

    </ol>
    <p>8.2. We may also provide our partners with anonymous information about how users, collectively, use the App and website so that they can understand how often people use their services, the App and the website.    </p>
    
    <h3>9. INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER INDIVIDUALS    </h3>
    <p>9.1. If you give us information (including personal information) on behalf of someone else, you confirm that the other person has given you permission to act on their behalf and has agreed that you can:    </p>
    <ol>
      <p>provide their personal information to us;    </p>
      <p>receive on their behalf any data protection notices; and    </p>
      <p>give consent to the transfer of their personal data abroad.    </p>

    <p>9.3. Where personal data has not been obtained from a data subject, this privacy policy explains how their data is processed.    </p>
    
    <h3>10. SECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF DATA    </h3>
    <p>10.1. We are committed to ensuring that your information will be treated confidentially and securely, and we have put in place appropriate measures to ensure the security of your personal data.    </p>
    <p>10.2. The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area (EEA) where the laws on processing personal data may be less stringent than in your country. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our agents or suppliers.    </p>
    <p>10.3. Presently, personal data collected from you is stored in data centres as well as cloud networks which are located or hosted in Ireland.    </p>
    <p>10.4. When your personal data is transferred to parties located outside of the EEA we will assess and take appropriate measures to ensure these third parties provide adequate security of such personal data and respect your rights to privacy. These safeguards are intended to ensure a similar degree of protection to your data wherever it may be transferred and may include:    </p>
    <ol>
      <p>only transferring your personal data to countries which have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or    </p>
      <p>entering into specific contractual terms which have been approved by the European Commission and which give personal data the same protection as within the EEA (for example, if transferring your data to the USA).    </p>
    </ol>
    <p>If you would like any more information on the safeguards used, feel free to contact us at musttmarketplace@gmail.com.    </p>
    
    <h3>11. DATA RETENTION    </h3>
    <p>11.1. We may hold on to your personal data for as long as we need to for the purposes for which it is processed or as is otherwise required by applicable law. If you terminate your account on the App and/or website, stop using the MUSTT Platform, we will delete your information as it is no longer relevant, but we might need to continue to process your personal data as required under applicable law, in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims where relevant.    </p>
    <p>11.2. We calculate the appropriate retention period for your data by considering the nature and sensitivity of the data, the purposes for which we are processing the data, and any applicable statutory retention periods. Using these criteria, we regularly review the personal data which we hold and the purposes for which it is held and processed. Once processing has been completed, we may securely delete or anonymise your personal data.    </p>
    <p>11.3. We may delete your account or specific information before deactivating your account if we believe it may no longer be relevant, or where an account has been inactive for more than a year. Purchase history may be deleted after 7 years.    </p>
